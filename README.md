Robo is a simple yet powerful Python-based voice assistant that listens to your voice commands and responds with useful actions such as playing music on YouTube, telling the time or date, and fetching information from Wikipedia. It combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, and virtual display handling for compatibility on headless environments like Google Colab.
